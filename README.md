# CodeNomad
## A fast, multi-instance desktop client for running OpenCode sessions the way long-haul builders actually work.

## What is CodeNomad?

CodeNomad is built for people who live inside OpenCode for hours on end and need a cockpit, not a kiosk. When terminals get unwieldy and web clients feel laggy, CodeNomad delivers a desktop-native workspace that favors speed, clarity, and direct control. It runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux using Electron + SolidJS, with prebuilt binaries so you can get started immediately.

## Highlights

- **Long-session native** – scroll through massive transcripts without hitches and keep full context visible.
- **Multiple instances, one window** – juggle several OpenCode instances side-by-side with per-instance tabs.
- **Deep task awareness** – jump into sub/child sessions (Tasks tool) instantly, monitor their status, and answer directly without losing your flow.
- **Keyboard first** – the full UI is optimized for shortcuts so you can stay mouse-free when you want to.
- **Command palette superpowers** – summon a single, global palette to jump tabs, launch tools, tweak preferences, or fire shortcuts. Every action is categorized, fuzzy searchable, and previewed so you can chain moves together in seconds. It keeps your workflow predictable and fast whether you are juggling one session or ten.
- **Developer-friendly rendering** – syntax highlighting, inline diffs, and thoughtful presentation keep the signal high.

## Requirements

- [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai) installed and available in your `PATH`, or point CodeNomad to a local binary through Advanced Settings.

## Repository Layout

CodeNomad now ships as a small workspace with two packages:

- `packages/ui` — SolidJS renderer, Tailwind styles, and standalone Vite configuration for building the UI bundle independently.
- `packages/electron-app` — Electron main/preload processes plus packaging scripts. It consumes the UI package during development/build via `electron-vite`.

Use `npm run dev --workspace @codenomad/electron-app` for the Electron shell and `npm run dev --workspace @codenomad/ui` for UI-only work. Working with the workspace requires Node.js 18+ with npm 7 or newer so the workspace protocol is available.

## Downloads

Grab the latest build for macOS, Windows, and Linux from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/shantur/CodeNomad/releases).

## Quick Start

1. Install the OpenCode CLI and confirm it is reachable via your terminal.
2. Download the CodeNomad build for your platform and launch the app.
3. Connect to one or more OpenCode instances, set keyboard shortcuts in preferences, and start a session.
4. Use tabs to swap between instances, the task sidebar to dive into child sessions, and the prompt input to keep shipping.

## CLI Server Flags

The bundled CLI server (`@codenomad/cli`) controls which folders the UI can browse when you pick a workspace:

- `--workspace-root <path>` (default: current working directory) scopes browsing to a safe subtree. The UI can only see folders beneath this root.
- `--unrestricted-root` explicitly allows full-machine browsing for the current process. In this mode the UI starts from the host home directory, adds a "parent" option so you can reach `/` on macOS/Linux, and lists drives/UNC paths on Windows. The flag is runtime-only—restart the CLI without it to go back to restricted mode.
- `--ui-dev-server <url>` proxies UI asset requests to a running Vite dev server while the CLI continues to expose its REST APIs and workspace proxies from the same port. Point this at `http://localhost:3000` when developing the renderer to keep hot reloads without sacrificing the single entry point.

Use unrestricted mode only when you trust the host; the CLI will skip directories it cannot read and never persists the opt-in.

### Single Port Proxying

Every OpenCode instance now tunnels through the CLI port. Each workspace descriptor publishes a stable `proxyPath` (e.g., `/workspaces/<id>/instance`), and the CLI exposes `GET/POST/...` + SSE at `http(s)://<cli-host>:<cli-port>${proxyPath}`. That means the UI, Electron shell, and browser clients only need firewall access to the CLI; instance ports stay private on `127.0.0.1`. In development, the `--ui-dev-server` flag still routes UI traffic through the CLI proxy so all instance calls share the same origin.
