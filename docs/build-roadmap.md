## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Process management complexity**
  - Mitigation: Extensive testing, graceful degradation
- **SSE connection stability**
  - Mitigation: Robust reconnection logic, offline mode
- **Performance with large sessions**
  - Mitigation: NOT a concern for MVP - defer to Phase 8
  - Accept slower performance initially, optimize later based on user feedback

### Product Risks

- **Feature creep**
  - Mitigation: Strict MVP scope, user feedback prioritization
- **Over-optimization too early**
  - Mitigation: Focus on functionality first, optimize in Phase 8
  - Avoid premature performance optimization
- **Platform inconsistencies**
  - Mitigation: Test on all platforms regularly
