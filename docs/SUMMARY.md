# OpenCode Client - Project Summary

## Current Status

We have completed the MVP milestones (Phases 1-3) and are now operating in post-MVP mode. Future work prioritizes multi-instance support, advanced input polish, and system integrations outlined in later phases.

## What We've Created

A comprehensive specification and task breakdown for building the OpenCode Client desktop application.

3. **Essential Features** (Week 3) - Markdown, agents, errors
4. **Multi-Instance** (Week 4) - Multiple projects support
5. **Advanced Input** (Week 5) - Commands, file attachments
6. **Polish** (Week 6) - UX refinements, settings
7. **System Integration** (Week 7) - Native features
8. **Advanced** (Week 8+) - Performance, plugins

## Task Breakdown

### Current Tasks (Phase 1)

**001 - Project Setup** (2-3 hours)

- Set up Electron + SolidJS + Vite
- Configure TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Create basic project structure
- Verify build pipeline works

**002 - Empty State UI** (2-3 hours)

- Create empty state component
- Implement folder selection dialog
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Style and test responsiveness

**003 - Process Manager** (4-5 hours)

- Spawn OpenCode server processes
- Parse stdout for port extraction
- Kill processes on command
- Handle errors and timeouts
- Auto-cleanup on app quit

**004 - SDK Integration** (3-4 hours)

- Create SDK client per instance
- Fetch sessions, agents, models
- Implement session CRUD operations
- Add error handling and retries

**005 - Session Picker Modal** (3-4 hours)

- Build modal with session list
- Agent selector for new sessions
- Keyboard navigation
- Loading and error states

**Total Phase 1 time: ~15-20 hours (2-3 weeks part-time)**

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Two-Level Tabs

- **Level 1**: Instance tabs (one per project folder)
- **Level 2**: Session tabs (multiple per instance)
- Allows working on multiple projects with multiple conversations each

### 2. Process Management in Main Process

- Electron main process spawns servers
- Parses stdout to get port
- IPC sends port to renderer
- Ensures clean shutdown on app quit

### 3. One SDK Client Per Instance

- Each instance has its own HTTP client
- Connects to different port (different server)
- Isolated state prevents cross-contamination

### 4. SolidJS for Reactivity

- Fine-grained reactivity for SSE updates
- No re-render cascades
- Better performance for real-time updates
- Smaller bundle size than React

### 5. No Virtual Scrolling or Performance Optimization in MVP

- Start with simple list rendering
- Don't optimize for large sessions initially
- Focus on functionality, not performance
- Add optimizations in post-MVP phases if needed
- Reduces initial complexity and speeds up development

### 6. Messages and Tool Calls Inline

- All activity shows in main message stream
- Tool calls expandable/collapsible
- File changes visible inline
- Single timeline view

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Task:

1. Read task file completely
2. Review related documentation
3. Follow steps in order
4. Check off acceptance criteria
5. Test thoroughly
6. Move to done/ when complete

### Code Standards:

- TypeScript for everything
- No `any` types
- Descriptive variable names
- Comments for complex logic
- Error handling on all async operations
- Loading states for all network calls

### Testing Approach:

- Manual testing at each step
- Test on minimum window size (800x600)
- Test error cases
- Test edge cases (long text, special chars)
- Keyboard navigation verification

## Next Steps

### To Start Building:

1. **Read all documentation**
   - Understand architecture
   - Review UI specifications
   - Study technical approach

2. **Start with Task 001**
   - Set up project structure
   - Install dependencies
   - Verify build works

3. **Follow sequential order**
   - Each task builds on previous
   - Don't skip ahead
   - Dependencies matter

4. **Track progress**
   - Update task checkboxes
   - Move completed tasks to done/
   - Update roadmap as you go

### When You Hit Issues:

1. Review task prerequisites
2. Check documentation for clarification
3. Look at related specs
4. Ask questions on unclear requirements
5. Document blockers and solutions

## Success Metrics

### MVP (After Task 015)

- Can select folder → spawn server → chat
- Messages stream in real-time
- Can switch agents and models
- Tool executions visible
- Basic error handling works
- **Performance is NOT a concern** - focus on functionality

### Beta (After Task 030)

- Multi-instance support
- Advanced input (files, commands)
- Polished UX
- Settings and preferences
- Native menus

### v1.0 (After Task 035)

- System tray integration
- Auto-updates
- Crash reporting
- Production-ready stability

## Questions to Resolve

Before starting implementation, clarify:

1. Exact OpenCode CLI syntax for spawning server
2. Expected stdout format for port extraction
3. SDK package location and version
4. Any platform-specific gotchas
5. Icon and branding assets location

## Estimated Timeline

**Conservative estimate (part-time, ~15 hours/week):**

- Phase 1 (MVP Foundation): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2 (Core Chat): 2 weeks
- Phase 3 (Essential): 2 weeks
- **MVP Complete: 6-7 weeks**

**Aggressive estimate (full-time, ~40 hours/week):**

- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 1 week
- Phase 3: 1 week
- **MVP Complete: 3 weeks**

Add 2-4 weeks for testing, bug fixes, and polish before alpha release.

## This is a Living Document

As you build:

- Update estimates based on actual time
- Add new tasks as needed
- Refine specifications
