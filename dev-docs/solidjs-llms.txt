# SolidJS Documentation

> Solid is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces with fine-grained reactivity. It compiles JSX to real DOM elements and updates only what changes, delivering exceptional performance without a virtual DOM. Solid provides reactive primitives like signals, effects, and stores for predictable state management.

SolidJS is a declarative JavaScript framework that prioritizes performance and developer experience. Unlike frameworks that re-run components on every update, Solid components run once during initialization and set up a reactive system that precisely updates the DOM when dependencies change.

Key principles:
- Fine-grained reactivity: Updates only the specific DOM nodes that depend on changed data
- Compile-time optimization: JSX transforms into efficient DOM operations
- Unidirectional data flow: Props are read-only, promoting predictable state management
- Component lifecycle: Components run once, with reactive primitives handling updates
